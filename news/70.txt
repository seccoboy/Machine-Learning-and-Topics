Latrobe Valley patients incorrectly billed for COVID-19 tests from pop-up medical centre 
A pop-up medical centre in the Latrobe Valley has incorrectly charged several of its patients a medical fee for COVID-19 testing. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, testing for the virus is free at public health facilities, mobile testing centres or GP bulk-billing clinics. Pensioner Sandra Dick, from Churchill, received an invoice from the Mid Valley Walk-through testing facility in Morwell, which is operated by Dorevitch Pathology. She said she was billed $91.80 after she was tested for coronavirus. "I received the bill in the mail, and it shocked me a bit because I was under the impression that it was free," Ms Dick said. "When I got the account, I was sort of a bit stunned because the doctor who supposedly referred me and the pathologist … I'd never heard of either of them." Independent State MP for Morwell, Russell Northe, said a number of concerned patients contacted his office about the issue, claiming Dorevitch did not bother to address the matter. "People were supposed to be informed via text or other means that it was a mistake but unfortunately there has been a cohort of people that haven't received that message," he said. "It's just imperative that every single person that was tested at that Mid Valley clinic has subsequently been advised by the authorities that they're not required to pay that bill." A spokesman from Dorevitch said patients were wrongfully billed due to a technical system glitch and a round of text messages have been sent to the patients advising them to disregard the bill. He said patients who do not receive texts will be phoned or a letter will be posted to their address.
