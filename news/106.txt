Poland delays presidential election after coronavirus, then protests, threw process into disarray
Poland's ruling party leader and a partner in the governing coalition announced an agreement late on Wednesday to postpone Sunday's presidential election, saying a new date will be chosen later. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of the ruling Law and Justice party, and Jaroslaw Gowin, leader of a small party in the conservative coalition, called their decision "a solution that will guarantee Poles the opportunity to participate in democratic elections". The May 10 date was set months ago, but the coronavirus pandemic and a government-ordered lockdown threw preparations for Sunday's election into disarray.  Bitter fighting between the conservative governing party and its political opponents kept them from agreeing on an alternative date.   Instead, the ruling party had sought to maintain the election schedule by making it a postal vote. But a disagreement between Kaczynski and Gowin had created a stalemate that had threatened to cause a larger political crisis. Their agreement suggests the crisis has been averted for now. Many in Poland voiced concerns that a postal vote organised on short notice might not be conducted property or even fairly. Nine former Polish prime ministers and presidents urged voters last month to boycott the ballot, claiming it could be unconstitutional. The group included Lech Walesa, who helped overthrow communism as head of the Solidarity trade union movement. Opinion polls at the end of April showed fewer than 30 per cent of Poles were likely to vote. AP/Reuters
