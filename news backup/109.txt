Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, reads to son Archie to promote Save the Children UK coronavirus campaign
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have thrown their celebrity power behind a campaign to bring food and learning resources to children and families struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic. A three-minute video was posted to the Instagram accounts of Save With Stories and Save the Children UK on Wednesday showing former US actor Meghan Markle reading a book to her son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. The video showed Meghan sitting with Archie, who turned one the same day, on her lap and reading one of his favourite books, Duck! Rabbit!. Archie grabs at the pages and helps turn them during the reading.  Dad Harry, who filmed the short video, whoops and says "bravo" from behind the camera at the end. Save the Children UK has called for a Family Rescue Package to ensure families have the support they need during the coronavirus crisis. The charity wants bigger tax benefits and more relaxed restrictions around jobseeker payments for those with children. Archie's parents chose not to pose with their newborn outside London's Portland Hospital when he was born and decided against giving the baby a royal name. He accompanied his parents on a tour of Africa at the age of four months and was introduced to Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Harry and Meghan shocked many early this year with an announcement they intended to quit as senior royals and split their time between Britain and North America. The couple officially stepped down from royal duties at the end of March, saying they were giving up public funding and seeking financial independence. The family went from living in a cottage on the grounds of Windsor Castle, to Vancouver Island in Canada and then on to Los Angeles before lockdown measures commenced. AP
