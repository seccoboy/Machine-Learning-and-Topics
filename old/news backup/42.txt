Relaxation of coronavirus restrictions at SA restaurants and pubs brought forward
Alcohol will be back on the menu at South Australian restaurants and cafes from Friday, as the State Government brings forward the relaxation of some coronavirus restrictions. The change will see restaurants will be able to seat up to 20 patrons â€” 10 indoor and 10 outdoor. South Australia's previous restriction roadmap contemplated restaurants only allowing 10 outdoor diners, with no alcohol until June 8. Now, pubs and clubs will be permitted to open on June 5, the Saturday of the Queen's Birthday long weekend. South Australia has had just one case of coronavirus detected in the past 28 days.
