Young people warned about coronavirus amid relaxed restrictions in restaurants and bars
Health authorities in NSW have confirmed three new cases of coronavirus from almost 9,000 tests done yesterday, bringing the state's total infections to 3,086. Of the three new cases, all were overseas cases identified during the mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine, Dr Christine Selvey from NSW Health said. She said there was no risk of community transmission from those cases. Health Minister Brad Hazzard said it was crucial that high testing rates continued, particularly as eased coronavirus restrictions meant restaurants and bars would open their doors to more patrons. "It's absolutely essential as we move forward and we try to relax some of the restrictions we've lived under for the past few months," he said. He highlighted that one in five people who tested positive for coronavirus have been within the 20-29 age bracket. "I want to emphasise again the danger of young people who may be asymptomatic or might have mild symptoms," he said. "As we are freeing up our restrictions, particularly around clubs and hotels and so on … these young people who may think they are invincible, are actually not invincible. "With these freedoms come big responsibilities." Under the relaxed coronavirus restrictions from June 1, hospitality venues will be required to adhere to strict guidelines to operate: Mr Hazzard refused to comment on the specifics of the rules, reiterating that industry consultation was ongoing, but stressed that social distancing was essential to the success of eased restrictions. When asked about when beauty therapists can commence business again, Mr Hazzard said plans were in motion but did not provide a timeline. Mr Hazzard also announced a $34 million program to train physiotherapists to deal with the "horrific lung conditions" associated with the virus.
