NSW coronavirus death toll climbs, bringing Australia's total to 101, as Government urges more testing
The NSW coronavirus death toll has climbed to 50 following the death of an 80-year-old Sydney woman, bringing Australia's total to 101. NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said the woman died from the virus last night in Sydney's Concord Hospital. Dr Chant said the woman was exposed to the virus when she attended an outpatient clinic at the hospital but there was no ongoing risk of transmission at the facility. There were three new coronavirus infections in the state yesterday, bringing the state's total to 3,084. All three cases are still under investigation but health authorities said they were not linked and were working to determine if they had been acquired in three different areas of Sydney. A total of 8,611 people were tested for COVID-19 in the 24 hours to 8:00pm yesterday. Dr Chant said the state had a high rate of testing, with more than 400,000 people swabbed since the pandemic began. "One negative test does not mean you are not going to get COVID-19," she said. She urged people to get tested multiple times, if they felt unwell. "We are going to need you to re-engage with testing ... every time you have new respiratory symptoms, you do need another test," she said. "That's particularly important as we come through to the winter season where we might see an upswing in other respiratory infections." Dr Chant also emphasised there was no room for delays in coming forward for testing and people shouldn't take the approach of "oh I'll just see how my sore throat develops".
